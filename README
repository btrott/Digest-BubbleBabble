NAME
    Digest::BubbleBabble - Create bubble-babble fingerprints

SYNOPSIS
        # Create a fingerprint of a simple string.
        use Digest::BubbleBabble qw( bubblebabble );
        my $fingerprint = bubblebabble( Digest => "Pineapple" );

        # Create a fingerprint of a SHA-1 hash.
        use Digest::SHA1 qw( sha1 );
        $fingerprint = bubblebabble( Digest => sha1("hello") );

DESCRIPTION
    *Digest::BubbleBabble* takes a message digest (often generated by either
    of the MD5 or SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates a fingerprint
    of that digest in "bubble babble" format. Bubble babble is a method of
    representing a message digest as a string of "real" words, to make the
    fingerprint easier to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real
    words, but they look more like words than a string of hex characters.

    Bubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite (and,
    consequently, by *Net::SSH::Perl*, the Perl SSH implementation) to
    display easy-to-remember key fingerprints. The key (a DSA or RSA key) is
    converted into a textual form, digested using *Digest::SHA1*, and run
    through *bubblebabble* to create the key fingerprint.

USAGE
    *Digest::BubbleBabble* conditionally exports one function called
    *bubblebabble*; to import the function you must choose to import it,
    like this:

        use Digest::BubbleBabble qw( bubblebabble );

  bubblebabble( Digest => $digest )
    Currently takes only one pair of arguments, the key of which must be
    *Digest*, the value of which is the actual message digest *$digest*. You
    should generate this message digest yourself using either *Digest::MD5*
    of *Digest::SHA1*.

    Returns the bubble babble form of the digest.
